# Voice-Gender-Prediction-code

Voice gender prediction is a process of using machine learning algorithms to determine the gender of a speaker based on their voice. The process typically involves analyzing various acoustic features of the speech signal, such as pitch, formants, and spectral characteristics, and then using these features to train a classifier that can predict the gender of a speaker.

The input to a voice gender prediction system is usually a speech signal recorded from a microphone or a phone call. The system then processes this signal to extract relevant acoustic features, which are used as input to a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be trained using a dataset of labeled speech samples, where each sample is labeled as male or female. Once the classifier is trained, it can be used to predict the gender of a new speaker based on their voice.
